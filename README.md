# Console trader is a console app to automate your daily trading tasks

The goal of this project is to automate common trading tasks by running  a bunch of trading scripts. The project is fully transparent and no sensitive api keys are stored. The code is open sourced and everyone is welcome to contribute. Every trading task is encapsulated in one command line (for future scripting).

## Exchange support
For now, Console trader supports Binance and Bitfinex. Supporting more exchanges is possible as project uses XChange wrapper to more than 60 cryptocurrency exchanges.
If you want to add another exchange, create PR and start from expanding ExchangeMatcher class.

## Use at your own risk
Console-trader is a work in progress. Use this software at your own risk. Always do your diligence before investing!
